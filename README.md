# Project Using Data Structures

In this project products can be added with their name, price and quantity. We can also 
modify the product’s name, price and quantity can be modified. Also we can delete and 
search the products available in the stock. So we can easily access the records of the 
products using this project. This project will also help the owners of the electronic 
equipment shops to carry out the day to day business in a smooth and organised way. 
Also, it saves a lot of time of the owners. 
Using this project adding, updating and deletion of records can be done which results in 
proper resource management of stock data.


## Methodology

In this project, linked list is used as the main data structure to add the products 
which will store the products in the memory. 
As we are using linked list so firstly a structure data type is defined in which product’s 
name and price are declared using one-dimensional array and the pointer pointing to the 
next node of the list is also declared which is of the same struct data type. 
Here, memory is allocated dynamically using malloc() function where the product’s 
information is stored. 
## Data Structures Used

 LINKED LISTS:

Linked list is a collection or sequence of nodes where each nodes has two parts. One part 
is for information and the other part is for pointer. 
Here the link pointer points to the next node present in the list.Linked lists are similar to 
arrays as both are linear data structure. The main difference is that the arrays elements are 
stored in contiguous memory locations and in linked lists, elements are stored in non 
contiguous memory locations. Also, in linked lists memory is not fixed, we can keep 
adding and removing elements without any capacity constraints. 


 ARRAYS:
  
An array is a collection of similar type of data items and each data item is called an 
element of the array. The elements of array share the same variable name but each 
element has a different index number known as subscript. 
In C, the subscripts starts from 0. 
Arrays can be single dimensional or multidimensional. The number of subscript 
determines the dimension of an array. Also, array is a linear data structure. In this project 
1-D arrays are used. 
## Deployment
